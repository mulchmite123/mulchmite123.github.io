<h4><font color="blue">Our next match is a premier league match against
club AFC Bournemouth who we played as our first home match of the season
where the scoreline diddnt turn out quite as we wanted. Yet that was when Pelligrini was
still setteling in at west ham when we had quite a bad start to the season
but with recent results this is a winnable match for us COYI</h4></font>
